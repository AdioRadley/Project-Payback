//Grocery Bill Splitter

//Purpose: input grocery bills as you receive them or at the time you wish to split them.  This
//input will look like a name and an amount, and perhaps the names of the rest of the people using those groceries.
//Optional inputs could be flags for splitting unevenly or other possible desires.
//Output will be a list of names (givers), amounts, and names (receivers).

//Involved will be the logic, the memory, and the interface.

//Take input from user
//Write something to file
//Read from file and output to command line
